# chess50

A chess AI built using minimax, alpha-beta-pruning, and Zobrist hashing algorithms

## Distribution

The directory comprises three files and a subdirectory:
1. [`runner.py`](runner.py), which contains the code to run chess50's graphical user interface
1. [`chess50.py`](chess50.py), which contains the code to implement the chess AI
1. [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt), which contains the list of dependencies
1. [`assets/`](assets/), the folder containing the fonts and images used in the project

## Setup

Open the Terminal, go to the `chess50/` directory, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running chess50

In the `chess50/` directory, run `python runner.py` in the Terminal.

## Features

1. **Choosing a side**. Once the `pygame` window opens, choose the side you want to play or you can let chess50 choose a side for you in a pseudorandom manner.

1. **Moving a chess piece**. To move a chess piece, click the piece you want to move and click the square to which you want it to move.

1. **Playing another game**. When the game is over, click "PLAY AGAIN" if you want to play another game.

1. **Resigning a game**. During your turn, click the flag icon below the chessboard to resign a game.
